Hey there, Joe here. I forked this from the [original](https://github.com/indieweb/blank-gh-site) on April 8, 2023 to make my new landing page at https://home.joeross.me. Then I worked around GitHub's refusal to let me fork the same project twice by uploading those files to this repo, trying to buid a landing page for https://joeross.dev.

# blank-gh-site
